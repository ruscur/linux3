  phys:
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/phandle-array
    description:
      List of all the USB PHYs on this HCD

  phy-names:
    description:
      Name specifier for the USB PHY

  maximum-speed:
   description:
     Tells USB controllers we want to work up to a certain speed. In case this
     isn't passed via DT, USB controllers should default to their maximum HW
     capability.
   $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/string
   enum:
     - low-speed
     - full-speed
     - high-speed
     - super-speed
     - super-speed-plus

  dr_mode:
    description:
      Tells Dual-Role USB controllers that we want to work on a particular
      mode. In case this attribute isn't passed via DT, USB DRD controllers
      should default to OTG.
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/string
    enum: [host, peripheral, otg]

  phy_type:
    description:
      Tells USB controllers that we want to configure the core to support a
      UTMI+ PHY with an 8- or 16-bit interface if UTMI+ is selected. In case
      this isn't passed via DT, USB controllers should default to HW
      capability.
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/string
    enum: [utmi, utmi_wide]

  otg-rev:
    description:
      Tells usb driver the release number of the OTG and EH supplement with
      which the device and its descriptors are compliant, in binary-coded
      decimal (i.e. 2.0 is 0200H). This property is used if any real OTG
      features (HNP/SRP/ADP) is enabled. If ADP is required, otg-rev should be
      0x0200 or above.
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/uint32

    description: Phandle of a companion device

  hnp-disable:
    description:
      Tells OTG controllers we want to disable OTG HNP. Normally HNP is the
      basic function of real OTG except you want it to be a srp-capable only B
      device.
    type: boolean

  srp-disable:
    description:
      Tells OTG controllers we want to disable OTG SRP. SRP is optional for OTG
      device.
    type: boolean

  adp-disable:
    description:
      Tells OTG controllers we want to disable OTG ADP. ADP is optional for OTG
      device.
    type: boolean

  usb-role-switch:
    description:
      Indicates that the device is capable of assigning the USB data role
      (USB host or USB device) for a given USB connector, such as Type-C,
      Type-B(micro). See connector/usb-connector.yaml.

  role-switch-default-mode:
    description:
      Indicates if usb-role-switch is enabled, the device default operation
      mode of controller while usb role is USB_ROLE_NONE.
    $ref: /schemas/types.yaml#/definitions/string
    enum: [host, peripheral]
    default: peripheral
